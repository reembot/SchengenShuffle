## Schengen Region Travel Calculator

The Schengen region is a subset of countries within the EU which share border control and travel visa restrictions.\
Tourists from the USA can travel through these countries for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period.

This simple calculator can help you plan how many days you'd like to spend in each country.

Prost!
